## So what's the site all about? 🤔

Fort.ind is a website I built during the 2019 pandemic. It was a small site at the time and was used as an unblocked games site. Over the years, it grew to something that I never knew would be so amazing :D

## What's coming? ✨

Everything here is done! If you've got ideas, please open an issue :P

- [x] finish fort.social instance (finished but configuring)
- [X] fix bugs
- [X] add more flash games
- [X] read your guys' ideas posted in [the form](https://forms.gle/K14hXqdQjfksyQnA8)
- [ ] rebuild the desktop app from the ground up
- [x] integrate a new CDN that isn't blocked and makes games load faster
